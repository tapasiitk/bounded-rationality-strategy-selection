## Overview

This repository contains the complete computational analysis and reproducible research code for **"When Bounded Rationality Predicts Optimal Behavior"** — a study investigating when humans behave rationally versus employing decision shortcuts.

**The Core Question:** Are systematic biases in human choice evidence of cognitive limitations, or adaptive responses to task demands?

**The Answer:** When information is easy to integrate (commensurable attributes), humans predominantly employ optimal strategies (97.4% of the time), eliminating systematic biases. This suggests that **bounded rationality can predict optimal behavior** when environmental conditions support it.

## Key Findings

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|-----------------|
| **Optimization Rate** | 97.4% | Participants used optimal integration when attributes were commensurable |
| **Rational Choices** | 89.1% | Selected superior options over inferior decoys |
| **Model Comparison** | ∆AIC = 23,175 | Overwhelming evidence for Effort-Based model over Salience-Based model |
| **Evidence Ratio** | > 10^5000 : 1 | Conclusive support for the hypothesis |
| **Model Fit** | r = 0.984 | Excellent prediction of observed choice distributions |
| **Attraction Effect** | BF₀₁ = 21.67 | No systematic bias observed (null hypothesis favored) |

## Theoretical Contribution

Rather than viewing decision biases as universal human limitations, this work demonstrates that:

1. **Strategy selection is context-dependent** — Individuals probabilistically choose between optimization and satisficing based on perceived cognitive effort.
2. **Commensurability is a boundary condition** — When attributes can be easily integrated, optimal processing emerges naturally.
3. **Bounded rationality predicts rationality** — Simon's framework can specify when humans will behave optimally, not just when they fail.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.10+** (Tested on Python 3.11.5)
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tapasiitk/bounded-rationality-strategy-selection.git
cd bounded-rationality-strategy-selection
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the Full Analysis
```bash
python scripts/01_model_analysis.py
```

This will:
- Load participant response data
- Fit both the **Effort-Based Strategy Selection** and **Rank-Based Salience** models
- Compare models using AIC and evidence ratios
- Run comprehensive validation (cross-validation, parameter recovery, robustness analysis)
- Print key results to console

**Expected output:**
```
Main Finding: λ = 0.974 (97.4% optimization)
Model Comparison: ∆AIC = 23,175 (overwhelming evidence)
Evidence Ratio: > 10^5000 : 1
Model Fit (r): 0.984
Cross-Validation Error: 0.054
```

### 4. Generate Figures
```bash
python scripts/02_plot_figures.py
```

This will generate publication-quality figures and save them to `figures/`.

### 5. Explore Interactively (Recommended)
Open and run the Jupyter notebook for a walkthrough of the entire analysis:
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/analysis_walkthrough.ipynb
```

## Computational Methods

### Models Implemented

**1. Effort-Based Strategy Selection Model** (Proposed)
- Individuals probabilistically choose between optimization and satisficing
- Optimization: Sum all information attributes
- Satisficing: Attribute-wise pairwise comparisons
- Parameter: λ (probability of optimization)

**2. Rank-Based Salience Model** (Baseline)
- Weights values based on momentary rank within each frame
- Explains systematic biases through salience-driven processing
- Parameters: w₁, w₂, w₃ (rank weights)

### Validation Framework

✅ **Maximum Likelihood Estimation** with parameter bounds  
✅ **5-Fold Cross-Validation** to assess generalization  
✅ **Parameter Recovery** testing to verify model identifiability  
✅ **Robustness Analysis** across multiple random initializations  
✅ **Bayesian Hypothesis Testing** (BF₀₁ = 21.67 for null attraction effect)

## Preregistration

This study was pre-registered prior to data collection on the Open Science Framework (OSF):  
🔗 **[View Preregistration](https://osf.io/kbnpa/overview?view_only=8d17cf39b4ce44de986fceb120f2e7e0)**

## Design Considerations

- **Commensurable Attributes**: All values presented as numerical magnitudes that can be directly compared
- **Multi-Attribute RSVP Paradigm**: 24 sequential frames (500ms each) before choice
- **Trials: 72 main trials + 24 catch trials**
- **Sample**: N = 17 participants (after exclusion criteria)
- **Trials**: 1,506 valid trials (92.3% retention after quality control)

---

## Reproducing the Results

The repository is designed for complete reproducibility:

1. All data is included (anonymized and pooled)
2. All code is deterministic (seeded random number generators)
3. Running `01_model_analysis.py` should produce results matching the paper exactly
4. Figure generation can be verified against `paper/absdm2025_paper.pdf`
